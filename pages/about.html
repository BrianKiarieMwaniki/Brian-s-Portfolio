          <h3>My background</h3>
          <p>
            I was first introduced to programming back in 2011 by my late
            cousin, and I built a simple calculator with
            <strong>Visual Basic</strong> and from then on I knew that I wanted
            to become a software developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have dabbled with a few programming languages and frameworks. In
            the recent past, I feel that I have settled more with the
            <strong>.NET Stack</strong> and <strong>Javascript</strong>. I am
            always learning and improving.
          </p>
          <p>
            I this past year, I have had the priviledge to work on software
            development in a professional setting. I have worked with senior
            developers from whom I have learned a lot.
          </p>

        <section class="about-main__developer-section">
          <h3>As a developer</h3>
          <p>
            I enjoy solving problems programmatically and improving
            solutions. I care about writing readable code and organizing my
            work. I will quickly come up with a solution to a problem get
            something working as quick as I can, but I will always come back to
            the solution to improve on it, my main agendas being readability,
            performance and organization. There's is always room for
            improvement!
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm excited to work on new projects, I see them as great
            opportunities to add on to what I already know and to learn
            something new.
          </p>

        <section class="about-main__persona-section">
          <h3>As a person</h3>
          <p>
            I would describe myself as being <strong>persistent</strong>. No
            matter the challenge, I don't back down until I have come up with a
            working solution. I'm also <strong>resourceful</strong>. I will
            experiment, research until I martial up a solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>I like learning and experimenting</strong>. Over the years,
            I've racked up a immense set of skills and experiences that all
            round make me a better software developer.

          <h3>As a colleague</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>I'm a team player,</strong> I enjoy being part of a team. I
            am confident I grow quicker and shine brighter when I am part of a
            team. I am always willing to help out a colleague and I am not shy
            asking for help from a colleague when I'm stack on task.That being
            said, I am also confident working as an individual with minimun
            supervision.
          </p>
