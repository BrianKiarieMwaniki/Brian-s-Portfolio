          <h3>My background</h3>
          <p>
            I was first introduced to programming back in 2011 by my late
            cousin, and I built a simple calculator with
            <strong>Visual Basic</strong> and I was locked in and from that day onwards I knew that I wanted
            to become a software developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have dabbled with a few programming languages and frameworks. In
            the recent past, I am have confidently settled with the
            <strong>C#</strong> and <strong>Javascript</strong>. I am
            always learning and improving.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have had the priviledge to work as a software
            developer professionally, there were moments the tasks were so hard I didn't think I could 
            ever be able to tackle them but I hang on, and am glad I did. Its from the most challenging tasks that 
            I have learned so much. Also helps with the confidence boost overcoming a challengeðŸ˜‰. I have learned so much 
            in the roles I have worked in and I can't help but feel that I still have more to learn and much more to offer.
          </p>

          <h3>As a developer</h3>
          <p>
            I enjoy solving problems and coming up with solutions and putting the solution into code.
            I am dogmatic about writing readable code and organizing my
            work. I will quickly come up with a solution to a problem to get
            something working as quick as I can, but I will always come back to
            the solution to improve on it, my main agendas being readability,
            performance and organization. There's is always room for
            improvement!
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm excited to work on new projects, I see them as great
            opportunities to add on to what I already know and to learn
            something new.
          </p>

        <section class="about-main__persona-section">
          <h3>As a person</h3>
          <p>
            I am <strong>persistent</strong>. No
            matter the challenge, I don't back down until I have come up with a
            working solution. I'm also <strong>resourceful</strong>. I will
            experiment, research until I martial up a solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love <strong>learning and experimenting</strong>. A simple blog will catch my eye and
            the next thing I know am seated in front of my computer trying out the things am reading. I still approach learning
            with the enthusiasm of a child.

          <h3>As a colleague</h3>
          <p>
            I'm a <strong>team player</strong>. I enjoy being part of a team. I
            am confident I grow quicker and shine brighter when I am part of a
            team. I am always willing to help out a colleague and I am not shy
            asking for help from a colleague when I'm stack on task.That being
            said, I am also confident working as an individual with minimun to no
            supervision.
          </p>
          <p>I have excellent communication skills. I feel comfortable conveying my ideas in creative ways so that anyone can understand them. </p>
